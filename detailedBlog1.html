                        If you're at the helm of a hosting business, you're well aware of the dynamic shifts in customer
                        demands. Today, it's all about fortifying cybersecurity, enabling remote work seamlessly, and
                        extracting actionable insights from data. Simultaneously, the drive to reduce operational costs
                        and accelerate time-to-market is relentless. As a result, businesses are making a fundamental
                        shift from on-premises solutions to embrace the boundless potential of the public cloud.
                        <br /><br />
                        As a hoster, you might find yourself at a crossroads. How do you maintain the satisfaction of
                        your current client base while expanding your offerings to cater to their growing appetite for
                        public cloud and Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions, all while ensuring your profitability
                        goals are met? The exciting news is that the world of public cloud services holds the key, with
                        partners witnessing staggering revenue growth—up to 20 times—when compared to their traditional
                        data center offerings. <br /><br />

                        To drive growth and profitability, we see partners making three key investments as they work to
                        capitalize on the market opportunity:
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>Modernizing Data Center Services: Staying competitive means staying current. Upgrade your
                            data center services to keep pace with the market and explore how Azure Stack can be a part
                            of that.</li>
                        <li>Ramping Up Public Cloud Practices: Faster growth comes from the cloud. Build and scale your
                            public cloud offerings to boost your revenue while expanding relationships with existing
                            customers and attracting new ones. Will talk more about this below. </li>
                        <li>3. Enhance Service Capabilities: It's not just about what you offer, but where you offer it.
                            Grow your service capabilities to include Azure and enhance your overall services
                            profitability. Make sure to read about what Forrester has to say on this below as well.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <br /><br />Now, let's pivot to licensing. We recently rolled out some exciting changes to enhance
                    what you can offer your customers. One of the key changes you want to be familiar with is the
                    Flexible Virtualization benefit, which lets customers with Software Assurance or Software
                    subscriptions outsource their hosting to dedicated or multi-tenant servers. (Please note these terms
                    are not available to Listed Providers. Listed providers as of this blog post are Azure, AWS, GCP,
                    and Alibaba). In addition, we also shared partners can also now license Windows Server on a vCore
                    basis per VM, which means better cost optimization for your data center customers. Another key
                    benefit from that announcement was the launch of the CSP-Hoster program. This program is all about
                    expanding the hosted solutions you can offer your customers. With CSP-Hoster, you can:
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>Host Windows 11 and M365-based desktop solutions.</li>
                        <li>Enable customers to bring their own licenses to your hosted solutions.</li>
                        <li>Resell 3-year CSP subscriptions with substantial discounts.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br /><br />
                    Right now, the CSP-Hoster program is open to direct CSP partners with Service Provider License
                    Agreements, but don't worry if you're not there just yet. We're planning to extend it to CSP
                    indirect resellers and Indirect Providers in the future. If you're eligible, you can dive into these
                    benefits by signing a CSP-Hoster amendment. For full details on this announcement see our post here:

                    <br /><br />
                    Although Microsoft continues to invest in your data center business, most of our investments are in
                    the public cloud where customer demand is strongest. Partners who offer public cloud solutions also
                    increase their customer retention rates, as one of the key drivers we see when customers churn is
                    the lack of a public cloud offering from their existing provider. To support our partners
                    modernization and enable our customers to get the most from our solutions, Microsoft has made
                    significant investments to build a world-class platform for partners, built around the CSP program
                    and Partner Center. The CSP program enables you as the partner to retain ownership of the customer
                    relationship, sell Microsoft cloud solutions and own the deployment and ongoing management,
                    resulting in accelerated topline revenue and EBIDTA. In parallel, our <a
                        href="https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft AI Cloud Partner
                        Program</a> (MAICPP) is here to support your differentiation and capabilities. Within the
                    MAICPP, you'll
                    find <a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/partnership/specialization">specializations</a>
                    that allow you to showcase your deep technical expertise, highlighting your
                    partner superpowers in specific domains. MAICPP also provides access to marketing content on-demand
                    found here:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Smart Partner Marketing aka.ms/smartpartnermarketing</li>
                        <li>Digital Marketing Content OnDemand aka.ms/dmc</li>
                        <li>Partner Marketing Center aka.ms/pmc</li>
                    </ul>
                    These resources proving access to offers that identify and accelerate customer demand and provide
                    pre-built solution plays that reduce the partners overall cost of sale.

                    These resources proving access to offers that identify and accelerate customer demand and provide
                    pre-built solution plays that reduce the partners overall cost of sale.<br /><br />
                    Partners transacting through CSP benefit from being able to offer services found only in the
                    Microsoft Cloud, including Microsoft 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop. CSP is not just a platform for
                    resale, it also presents the opportunity to create new managed services and intellectual property,
                    ultimately boosting your overall profitability. Once you’ve joined the CSP program, expanding across
                    the solution portfolio is key to accelerated growth.<br /><br />
                    The Microsoft cloud also empowers you to bring new capabilities to market at a much faster pace. For
                    instance, you can launch a true desktop as a service offering, without the need to invest in costly
                    upfront infrastructure or worry about predicting demand. By combining the capabilities of your data
                    center with Microsoft Cloud solutions, you can not only attract new customers but also retain
                    existing ones who are looking at Public Cloud options as they seek to meet industry requirements or
                    benefit from new innovation, like Artificial Intelligence.<br /><br />
                    We recognize it’s a big shift when partners pivot to the public cloud over their data center. As
                    we've engaged in our partners transformation we've observed several noteworthy trends that validate
                    their investments and strategic shift :
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>We see partners grow faster when they expand offerings to focus on public cloud solutions.
                            Our partners win new customers, grow existing relationships and improve customer retention
                            as they migrate on-premises customers to cloud-based solutions. The migration of existing
                            customers often occurs at strategic times, such as a pending infrastructure refresh or
                            customer contract expiration.</li>
                        <li>Transitioning to Azure also enables partners to reach new markets, leveraging Microsoft's <a
                                href="https://datacenters.microsoft.com/globe/explore">Azure global infrastructure</a>
                            to enhance their end-customer experience and reach new customers.</li>
                        <li>Partners frequently generate initial cloud customers from their existing install base. One
                            way Microsoft supports this is by providing leads through the <a
                                href="https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/cloudascent">CloudAscent
                                Program</a>. CloudAscent data provides valuable insights for upselling and cross-selling
                            within your current customer base, rapidly aligning your sales outreach with customers
                            intent. It enables you find migration and growth opportunities across your installed base,
                            aligned to solution plays to accelerate those sales conversations. CloudAscent data is one
                            of the fastest ways our partners generate new wins. </li>
                        <li>Strategic alignment at the exec level, including sales compensation that incents cloud
                            outcomes and enablement of Partner technical teams to support Microsoft Cloud solutions are
                            all critical to a successful partner transformation. </li>
                        <li>Understanding Azure costs and the complexity of a cloud migration is crucial. Partners can
                            utilize the <a href="https://usdco.azurewebsites.net/Resources.aspx">Azure Rapid Assessment
                                Estimator</a> to determine projected costs for data center moves to Azure, facilitating
                            informed decision-making for both the partner and their customers. </li>
                    </ol>
                    We also engaged with <a
                        href="https://www.microsoft.com/azure/partners/partner-opportunity-transitioning-data-center-hosted-managed-services-to-azure">Forrester</a>
                    to better understand the economic impact of a partner transition.
                    <a
                        href="https://www.microsoft.com/azure/partners/partner-opportunity-transitioning-data-center-hosted-managed-services-to-azure">Forrester</a>
                    found that partners who make this transition from the data center to public cloud managed
                    services could gain a 76% return on investment, and a 31% gross margin blend across public cloud
                    resale plus managed services. The key driver of profitability, with up to 70% gross margins was
                    managed services and shows how building a robust Managed Services offering is the key to increasing
                    your profitability and differentiating yourself in the market as a public cloud services provider.
